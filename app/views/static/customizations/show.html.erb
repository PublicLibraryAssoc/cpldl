        "We loved the DigitalLearn courses already but the product didn't allow us
        to follow progress of our learners the way we wanted to. Our first attempt
        at a solution was to downloaded all of the digitallearn modules into a
        learning management system and pilot the program for six months.
        The product gave us what we wanted but because we were being charged per
        user by our provider, it quickly became too expensive for us to maintain.
        We needed a product that would provide us the same features but at a much
        lower cost. That's when vie decided to work with PLA to build a custom
        DigitalLearn site."

        "We wanted to add some resources to DigitalLearn to help people with
        digital literacy skills in the Kalamazoo area. We first considered
        creating our own in-house solution but when I learned about DigitalLearn's
        custom sties and brought it to my IT team, we found that the price was a
        steal. We also factored in the hours we'd have to put in-to building
        something on our own and it just seemed like a no-brainer to work with PLA."

  <h3>Don't Go at it Alone</h3>
  <p>
    As the needs of our communities change, public libraries are continually
    being asked to do more with less. We know funding for new initiatives such as
    digital literacy training may not be in your budget. The good news?
    Support for digital literacy training is strong.
